# TopoGen3D: Topology-Aware Open3D Code Generation from 2D Images

TopoGen3D is an innovative pipeline that transforms 2D images of shapes (such as a torus or a Klein bottle) into fully-functional Open3D code. By leveraging a fine-tuned CLIP model and IBMâ€™s Granite-3B-Code-Instruct-2k model, TopoGen3D automatically identifies the best matching shape based on accuracy scores and then generates corresponding Open3D code. The resulting code can be rendered in a web environment or visualized using PyVista.

## Overview
TopoGen3D automates the process of generating 3D models from 2D images by combining advanced deep learning techniques with state-of-the-art 3D rendering tools. The pipeline consists of three main steps:

1. **2D Image Input**: Provide an image of a shape.
2. **Shape Detection & Scoring**: A fine-tuned CLIP model evaluates and scores potential shapes.
3. **3D Code Generation**: The highest-scoring shape description is fed into IBM Granite-3B-Code-Instruct-2k to generate Open3D code.

## Features
- **Topology-Aware Recognition**: Accurately identifies complex topological shapes such as torus and Klein bottles.
- **Automated Code Generation**: Transforms shape descriptions into executable Open3D code using a powerful IBM model.
- **Versatile Visualization**: Render the generated 3D model in a web application or using PyVista for interactive visualization.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrates with various components such as CLIP, IBM Granite, and Open3D.

## How It Works
1. **Input Image**:  
   A 2D image of a shape is provided as input (e.g., a torus or a Klein bottle).

2. **Shape Scoring with CLIP**:  
   A fine-tuned CLIP model processes the image and generates accuracy scores for a range of possible shapes based on a predefined JSON knowledge base.  
   - All possible shapes and their confidence scores are printed.  
   - The shape with the highest score is selected.

3. **Code Generation with IBM Granite**:  
   The best scoring shape description is saved to a file and then fed to the IBM Granite-3B-Code-Instruct-2k model, which generates Open3D code to create a 3D model of the identified shape.

4. **Visualization**:  
   The generated Open3D code can be rendered either in a web environment or visualized using PyVista.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Transformers
- Open3D
- PyVista
- Pillow
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt` (if provided)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TopGen.git
   cd TopGen
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
    
## Usage

### Step 1: Generate Image Description
Run the script to process a 2D image and generate a shape description:

```bash
python main.py
```
This script calls `clip.py` with the image path, which detects shapes and writes the highest confidence description to `description.txt`.

### Step 2: Generate 3D Open3D Code
The same `main.py` then calls `granite_code.py`, which reads the description and uses IBM Granite to generate the Open3D code.

### Step 3: Visualize the Generated Model
After code generation, use a visualization script (e.g., `visualization.py`) to render the 3D model:
```bash
python visualization.py
```
